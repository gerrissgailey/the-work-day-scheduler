# JavaScript Code Quiz

This project was designed to serve as a web app for tracking an individual's work day schedule.

This work day scheduler features:

- Color coded time slots set to a 9 to 5 workday. Grey colored time slots are for past hours of the day. The red colored time slot is the current hour. And the green colored time slots are for future hours of the day.

- A current date display at the top of the page

- Simple functionality for a user to select a time slot, enter an event, and save the event to the scheduler.

- Storing of events to the browser's local storage, allowing a user to close the scheduler and re-open at a later time with all their scheduled events remaining loaded for their work day.
